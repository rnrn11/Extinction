			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>	The Woolie Mammoth is an extinct animal from prehistoric times. The appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any prehistoric animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and Alaska, as well as skeletons, teeth, and depiction from life in prehistoric cave paintings. The woolie mammoth coexisted with early humans, who used its bones and tusks for making art, tools, and dwellings, and the species was also hunted for food. After its extinction, humans continued using its ivory as a raw material.</p>

			<h3>How Mammoths survived the cold</h3>

			<p>	Woolie mammoths had several adaptations to the cold, most noticeably the layer of fur covering all parts of the body. Other adaptations to cold weather include ears that are far smaller than those of modern elephants; they were about 15 inches long and 7-11 inchesacross, and the ear of the 6â€“12 month old frozen calf "Dima" was under 5 inches long. The small ears reduced heat loss and frostbite, and the tail was short for the same reason, only 14 inches long.</p>
			<h3>Diet</h3>
			<p>	Food at various stages of digestion has been found in the intestines of several woolie mammoths, giving a good picture of their diet. Woolie mammoths sustained themselves on plant food, mainly grass. Woolie mammoths needed a varied diet to support their growth, like modern elephants. An adult of six tonnes would need to eat 387 pounds daily, and may have foraged as long as twenty hours every day. The two-fingered tip of the trunk was probably adapted for picking up the short grasses of the last ice age by wrapping around them, whereas modern elephants curl their trunks around the longer grass of their tropical environments.</p>
			<h3>Extinction</h3>
			<p> Most woolly mammoth populations disappeared during the late Pleistocene and early Holocene.Scientists are divided over whether hunting or climate change, which led to the shrinkage of its habitat, was the main factor that contributed to the extinction of the woolly mammoth, or whether it was due to a combination of the two. Whatever the cause, large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates. The last known population remained on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean until 4,000 years ago, well into the start of human civilization and concurrent with the construction of the Great Pyramid of ancient Egypt.</p>
